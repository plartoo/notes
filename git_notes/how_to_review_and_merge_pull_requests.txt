> git remote -v # check to make sure the remote is properly added above
> git fetch tittetoo # pull latest code from tittetoo's repo (the one tittetoo has requested to pull and review)
> git branch -a # see all local and remote brnaches; plartoo should see tittetoo's south_africa branch that is requested for pull 
> git checkout -b review_tittetoo tittetoo/south_africa # check out tittetoo's south_africa branch to a new branch for review
> git diff main review_tittetoo # see what tittetoo has changed
> git log -1 -p (or -2, -3, however many you need to see the commit messages that tittetoo has done)
# review code and if you like it, merge that to your (plartoo's) main branch
> git checkout main
> git merge review_tittetoo
> git branch -D review_tittetoo # delete the review branch now that we have merged it to the main branch
