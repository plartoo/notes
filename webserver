Which Web Server is running?
=============================
telnet ip.of.host 80
*If that works you should get something like this:
Trying 192.168.0.3....
Connected to 192.168.0.3.
Escape character is '^]'.
*You'll be at a blank line, now type this and hit enter twice:
GET / HTTP/1.1


APACHE restart
===============
    Su to root.
    Run the apache control program:
    apachectl graceful
    You can also run the apache control program in this way:
    apachectl restart

Tips:

    graceful reloads the configuration files and gracefully restart. Any current connections are allowed to complete.
    restart reloads the configuration files and restarts. Any current connections are terminated immediately.
