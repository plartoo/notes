Then follow feature branch flow to do commits as below:

1. Open up Git shell (not windows cmd shell). There:

Switched to a new branch 'feature/cancel_conversation_launch'

2. Summary of actions:
- A new branch 'feature/cancel_conversation_launch' was created, based on 'devel
op'
- You are now on branch 'feature/cancel_conversation_launch'

3. Now, start committing on your feature. For example:
C:\Users\lacheephyo\Documents\GitHub\t4sdev [feature/test_send_china +0 ~2 -0]>
git add t4s/smsmessages/utils.py
C:\Users\lacheephyo\Documents\GitHub\t4sdev [feature/test_send_china +0 ~1 -0 |
+0 ~1 -0]> git commit -m "We will add '+' now regardless of destination country

========

Once ready to test out on t4s.urmc-sh, sudo as "root" and
[root@t4s t4s]# service httpd restart

========

If things don't seem to be working as expected on T4S server:
[root@t4s ~]# tail -f /var/log/httpd/t4s.urmc-sh.rochester.edu-access_log

Grab twilio URL something like this:
http://localhost:8000/messages/receive/?ToCountry=US&ToState=NY&SmsMessageSid=SM7e383a5cb934498c5bf0dd138ffb1386&NumMedia=0&ToCity=ROCHESTER&FromZip=&SmsSid=SM7e383a5cb934498c5bf0dd138ffb1386&FromState=NY&SmsStatus=received&FromCity=&Body=Testing&FromCountry=US&To=%2B15854548833&ToZip=14609&MessageSid=SM7e383a5cb934498c5bf0dd138ffb1386&AccountSid=AC14415ab0be51ba4da097dd51da5a7d8f&From=%2B15856268095&ApiVersion=2010-04-01

Then paste it in localhost:8000 and see what it gets using ipdb and etc.


Also, you can check the DB content here
https://t4s.urmc-sh.rochester.edu/mywebsql/
and go to "smsmessages_messagerecord" last page to see if the message is failing or successful in sending.

Restart Cron:
$ service crond restart





Day 5
Django South:
http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/part1.html
To create migration file:
C:\Users\lacheephyo\Documents\GitHub\t4sdev\t4s>python manage.py schemamigration accounts (or any app/model's name) --initial
To create an entry in Migrations table:
C:\Users\lacheephyo\Documents\GitHub\t4sdev\t4s>python manage.py migrate accounts  --fake

To check the DB models. If something changed, it'll create a migration file in the model's folder:
C:\Users\lacheephyo\Documents\GitHub\t4sdev\t4s>python manage.py schemamigration accounts --auto

Then we finally do:
python manage.py migrate <appname>

Kapor's github trick:
C:\Users\lacheephyo\Downloads\test>git remote set-url origin git@github.com:text4strength/test.git

Gitflow:
https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Windows


Day 7
how to update and migrate using South

Given you want to start from afresh (move code from local machine to server).
[Drop DB if any old one is lingering around; Create new DB with utf8 as default charset]
1. Do sync DB
2. Create migration files using $ manage.py <app_name> schemamigration --initial
???? check with Kapor to see what needs to be done here (something that ends with --auto)
3. python manage.py migrate on server
That's it.

Other things I learned:
python manage.py collectstatic 
will collect all static files across all different apps in a project into a specific folder defined in proj/app/settings.py



Django Migration

C:\Users\lacheephyo\Documents\GitHub\t4sdev\t4s>python manage.py schemamigration
 smsmessages --auto

C:\Users\lacheephyo\Documents\GitHub\t4sdev\t4s>python manage.py migrate
