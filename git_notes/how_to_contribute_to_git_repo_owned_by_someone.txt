Overview
---------
This guide will help learn how to contribute to other people's open-source code hosted on Github using Git and your own Github account.

The general steps involved are:
1) you (say your username is "tittetoo") wll fork and clone a Github repo owned by another person (say owned by username, "plartoo") into your Github repository.
2) make some code development in the cloned repo on your computer locally
3) then fetch from the source repo to see if the owner (plartoo) has done any udpate to his/her code
4) if so, merge his/her changes to your local (cloned) repo and test with your local code changes to make sure everything is working
5) then commit your local changes to your own local repo
6) asked for pull request so that the owner of the source repo (plartoo) can review and maybe merge your changes to his/her repo


Step-by-step instructions begin here:
-------------------------------------
First make sure you have installed Git [https://git-scm.com/downloads] and have a Github account.
1. Now log in to your Github account (e.g., username: tittetoo).
2. Then go to the repository that you want to contribute--e.g., this one: [https://github.com/plartoo/others]
3. Click 'Fork'. This will copy the same repo in your Github account 'tittetoo'.
4. Then clone that repo in 'tittetoo' by doing this in the commandline window:
> git clone git@github.com:tittetoo/others.git

5. First, check to see where your remotes are pointing to. Think of remotes as the repositories where you will pull from or push the code to.
> git remote -v
origin  git@github.com-tittetoo:tittetoo/others.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com-tittetoo:tittetoo/others.git (push)

Notice that, the 'git remote -v' command above returns the results without plartoo (the source repo that you are trying to contribute to). 
We need to add plartoo as a remote as below:
> git remote add plartoo https://github.com/plartoo/others.git

# after typing the command above, you should now see two lines starting with plartoo when you type 'git remote -v'
> git remote -v
origin  git@github.com-tittetoo:tittetoo/others.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com-tittetoo:tittetoo/others.git (push)
plartoo        https://github.com/plartoo/others.git (fetch)
plartoo        https://github.com/plartoo/others.git (push)

Note: The above 5 steps only need to be carried out ONCE. Once you forked and cloned a repo, you only need to do the steps below instead.

6. Now, just to make sure you have the latest code from the source repo (plartoo's repo), do this:
> git branch # check to see which branch you are on
*some_branch
main

# if you are not on 'main' branch as shown above, do this:
> git checkout main
> git branch
*main
some_branch

Now let's pull from the source repo, so that your 'main' branch is synced with the latest from the source repo's 'main' branch.
> git fetch plartoo # REF: https://stackoverflow.com/a/7244456 and https://web.archive.org/web/20200610210250/https://nearsoft.com/blog/how-to-synchronize-your-github-fork/

7. Now, you can create a new branch to do your own code contribution. Let's create a new branch:
> git branch south_africa 
> git checkout south_africa
(or just do 'git checkout -b south_africa')
# do some coding
> git add <files_that_you_changed/added>
> git commit -m "Type a useful and detailed commit message for reviewer here."

8. If you are satisfied with your code contribution, you are ready to submit a pull request.

We can submit a pull request via Github. Log in to your account (tittetoo) on Github. Navigate to your forked repo:
https://github.com/tittetoo/others
There you should see something like what's shown in "git_repo_contribute_1.png" (note that the pull request shown is for the branch 'south_africa').
Click on the 'Pull Request' or 'Compare & Pull Request' button. Then write messages for the source repo owner (plartoo).
Once you clicked 'Submit', you'll see something like what's shown in "git_repo_contribute_2.png".

That's it! Now the source repo owner (plartoo) will decide if s/he wants to merge your contribution or not.
