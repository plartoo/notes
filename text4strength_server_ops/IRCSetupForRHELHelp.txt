=========

Steps to take:
1. Register your IRC nick:
/msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com
Replace password with a secure, unguessable password that you keep secret.

2. The email address that you select will not be given out by staff, and is 
mainly used to allow us to help you recover the account in the event that you 
forget your password. For this reason, you are required to use a real, 
non-disposable, email address. Upon registering, you will receive an email 
with a verification command that you will need to run to complete the registration 
process. Failure to verify the account will cause it to be automatically dropped 
after about 24 hours.

3. To keep your email address private, rather than displaying it publicly, 
mark it as hidden (which is done by default for new accounts):

/msg NickServ SET HIDEMAIL ON

4. Then identify to your primary account:

/msg NickServ IDENTIFY plartoo askRedHat

5. /join #rhel
