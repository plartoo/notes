If you have more than one Github accounts and you want to use both of them in your computer, read the following blog:
https://web.archive.org/web/20200610210659/https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/manage-multiple-github-accounts-the-ssh-way-2dadc30ccaca/

The general idea is to 
1. generate separate SSH keys--one for each github account (see REFs below on Github on how to generate new SSH keys and embed them in your Github account) 
2. In 'C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\config' file, link each SSH (RSA) key files with each of your github accounts.
3. In '[path_to_local_folder_of_the_git_repo_you_want_to_push_code_from]\.git\config', make sure that the name and email are accurate to that of your account. 
In addition, make sure that the url of remote "origin" matches that defined in '~.\ssh\config' file.

===========
Example 'C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\config' file:
# Personal account, - the default config
Host github.com
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Work account-1
Host tootp.github.com
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_tootp_github_accnt

# Account-2
Host github.com-tittetoo
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_tittetoo_github_accnt
